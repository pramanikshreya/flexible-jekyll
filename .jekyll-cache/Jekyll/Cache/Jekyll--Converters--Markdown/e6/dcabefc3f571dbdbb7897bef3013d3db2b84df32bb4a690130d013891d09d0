How will they reach the office without their uniforms you may ask? Even they have no clue. Also, emergency servicing of LPG cylinders (considering they are a blasting danger to the weak meaty humans), are not essential services.

<p>This is bang in the middle of a very modern part of the metro city Kolkata called Newtown. I wonder what happens to the poorest of the poor villages and cities who don't have other mechanisms like induction or microwave.</p>
<p>I read about Zomato guys getting beaten up, lakhs of truck and drivers stuck at the border, and bawling labourers not knowing where to go as they got stuck in the middle of nowhere with no money.

A framework that sustains life with compassion and leaves no one behind in the era where disasters are no longer clustered in a geographic epicentre.</p>
