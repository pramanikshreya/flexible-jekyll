I"ô<p>When we talk about climate change all we talk about is news like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4" src="/assets/67191588_2375106052607683_1232674129556013056_n.jpg" alt="67191588_2375106052607683_1232674129556013056_n" width="461" height="960" /></p>
<p>And then it directly shifts to consumers in terms of how to save water, plant trees and what not. Although that is a habit that needs to be there for the better, how are we still leaving industries from the conversation?</p>
<p>But these are not gonna help, unless we actually know what are the steps that we are taking that is causing the most depletion of resources. For instance, textile industry is the most water intensive industry after agriculture and electricity production (coal). What can we do to reduce that? The conversation is quite a long one. I would like to touch upon each of the industries in terms of what can be done to save the planet (starting with our country). Hoping this will someday be read or seen.</p>
