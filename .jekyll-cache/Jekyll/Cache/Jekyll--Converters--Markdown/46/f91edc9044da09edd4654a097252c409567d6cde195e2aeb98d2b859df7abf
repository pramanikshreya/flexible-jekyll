I";<p>My brain boils so much when the so called competent banks of this nation talk about using Blockchain AI chatbot and some other random shit to throw people's money at.</p>
<p>A simple function of NEFT/IMPS transfer is so tedious that it makes a techie like me bang my head in dispair. How hard is it to make a portal that can take a transfer request. Who are the shitheads that are even making this bloody thing and think their portal should be AI enabled. It should be fed to crows and eat the crows shit so that some sense comes into the so called decision makers. Sirji, make the basics work first before promising or attempting to change the sky. Or atleast hire some competent people or startups who can do the job for you instead of throwing your money at huge behemoths to maintain the code written in VB in 1947.</p>
