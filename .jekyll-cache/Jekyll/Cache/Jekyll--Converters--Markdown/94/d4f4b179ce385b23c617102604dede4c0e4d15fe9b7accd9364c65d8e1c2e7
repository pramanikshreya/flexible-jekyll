<p>The homo sapiens are a contradictory species. If something goes wrong, instead of actually asking what went wrong and how could I prevent it, they accept seemingly useless conclusions like, I had too much work or bandwidth problem, hence I could not do that one thing I did properly.</p>

<p>Why did you have a bandwidth problem, when you did only task at a time. Is it possible because you had 10 thousand whatsapp accounts , and 2 million slack accounts to read things from. Or maybe you missed adding the percentages to confirm the sum is hundred before sending a vital payment email to a vendor.</p>

<p>In this pandemic crazed, wfh era, the communications gaps widen and it is even more important for double checks and streamlining communications than ever before. But who cares right? It is a situation problem not something I did problem ever. Meh!</p>
