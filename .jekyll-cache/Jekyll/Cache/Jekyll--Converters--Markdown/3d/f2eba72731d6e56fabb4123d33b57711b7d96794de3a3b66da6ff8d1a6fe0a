<p>I write this after cyclones, yeah two of them hit very close to our business bases within 10 days, amidst the pandemic and locust attacks. As a human being I find myself, in the middle of a lot of people who are as stressed out as me. I don't see a way forward from this, right now, at this point the adrenalin the newness of the pandemic and wfh jokes have dialed down. And we find ourselves in an extremely unfamiliar grounds, with uncertainity and screaming members of homo sapiens all around regarding a number of things, like race, religion, government, case, creed, economy, disease, climate change, animal cruelty. A human has a finite number of fucks to be given. As aptly mentioned in the book "The Subtle Art of <b>Not Giving</b> a F*ck".</p>
<p>Some salient quotes from the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.”</p>
<p>“The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. (p.9)”</p>
<p>“You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked.”</p>
<p>“Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.”</p>
<p>“To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action;”</p>
<p>“Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual. We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we don’t even know what to give a fuck about anymore.”</p>

<p>I think this book is one of the most close to heart books I have ever read, and can relate to at this weird point in time. To summarize, a lot of problems around you, don't give a fu*k about everything, choose your battles, lay low, and just SURVIVE!!</p>
<p>When you are feeling overwhelmed, give a call to a closed one, be vulnerable, be compassionate. Everytime you have an urge to scream at someone, just know that you might be dead tomorrow, like really! And do you really want to spend the last day of your life doing this.</p>
<p>Hallelujah! Live long and prosper. Be vulcan, and a little less human (read emotional).</p>
