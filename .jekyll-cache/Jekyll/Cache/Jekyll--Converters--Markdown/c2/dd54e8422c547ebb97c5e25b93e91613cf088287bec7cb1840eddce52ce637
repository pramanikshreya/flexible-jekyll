I"Ö<p>Humans have a problem of processing large numbers.</p>
<p>The gentleman below, is a Mentor of change and part of Niti Ayog and Atal Innovation etc. commenting on another reputed investors post who believes this lockdown is a joke and an incovenience for the entire population just for 0.00001% sufferings. Let's break down the numbers.</p>
<p>0.00001% population of India is <strong>137.9</strong>. Current active case load is <strong>1,26,451</strong>.</p>
<p>0.00001% population of world is <strong>759.43</strong>. Current active case load is <strong>3,206,524</strong>.</p>

<p>It seems humans donâ€™t really know how to process figures which they canâ€™t personally relate to, and this has surprising consequences. Like the fact that the lockdown bought us precious days to setup our nearly non existant medical infra, to help people who would need it by pushing the days required to jump from 100 to 1 lakh cases to 64 days. Could the lockdown have been implemented more efficiently, ofcourse yes!</p>
<p>Would our country single handedly collapse, due to the pandemic in 30 days if not for the lockdown probably yes. Has the trouble far gone behind? Absolutely no.</p>
<p>Should you venture out unless absolutely required? Fuck no. If you want the sacrifices you put up till now to really work, <strong>stay at home</strong> unless you are literally saving a person or the country's economy. If you can do it from home, great!</p>
<p>Don't let numbers de-empathize you. Everyone of you have visited a hospital at some point in life, you must have an idea by now, that even a large hospital doesn't have critial patient capacity of more than 50 in a specific wing. Imagine the building filled with corpses, and many buildings like that with wailing family members unable to see them. Everyone of you also must have seen a close one die, imagine many lifeless human bodies floating at every location you love. If that doesn't produce empathy, then go out, because you are a closeted psycopathic murderer anyways. Go kill yourself and others.</p>

<p>Post edit note:</p>
<p>A lot of controversies on what should be the priority, life or livelihood.</p>
<p>My two cents on that:</p>
<p>People should choose life, I would choose life. But turns out, many people's life just revolve around livelihood, without that they really have no clue who they are. Massive existential crisis. The simple fact that if you are alive, you can figure out how to live, is lost on people. This is drilled upon the mindsets of children from a very early age. During academics, co-curricular and so on. Learn, love and passion can solve the problem of livelihood for anyone.<br />
There is another core mindset that is a problem, for majority, they think it is the job of the government to provide jobs, livelihood etc. Maybe it is not. Maybe the person should have a basic mindset to save for two months expense, or not have kids if they cannot afford it. Government cannot provide everything.</p>
