<p>One of my pet peeves is this problem. Yield, water management, farming techniques used. There are farmers in this country who have used ingenious methods to solve this. I believe those can be extrapolated with careful calibration to scale the concept of sustainable farming. Everybody wins in this problem statement. Farmers, economy, water scarcity, people who eat the food, soil or land. So much of the lifestyle diseases can be solved through just food and that starts at the point of growing. Just selling a screw driver (hydroponic kits) won't solve this. It requires a combination of all the tools available to us. And to create a model basis the climate zones. Should be like a buffet menu for farmers.</p>
