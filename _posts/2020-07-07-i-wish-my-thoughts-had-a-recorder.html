<p>They are so fast and well articulated, typing and speaking slows me down. And then blobs of flesh speak and make the well thought out things absolute garbage by interrupting a thousand times. I think I hate digital communications is an understatement. The lag, the lack of human expressions, the lack of decipheribility, makes it an absolute prime place for a major fucking conflict to happen. </p>

<p>The hidden cost of this pandemic is anxiety, and extremely rude behaviour by the fleshy blobs. We should be kinder to each other, not assume the worst, and preferanly not speak if it is to question everything the other person is doing, unless they actually have any positive strand of converstation to add. </p>
<p>Now if you are trapped in a room, with no social life, human brains change. There is no question about it (Read Prison experiments). The question is what you can do about it. Have a family/friend/ or loved one when you are spiraling down. You cannot do it alone. Have a picture of a visit to a place that brings a smile to your face instantly at hand (or as a wallpaper). So you can stare at it, when feeling crazy. Have a hobby, as Scott puts it-</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Pay special attention to things that bring you joy that don’t involve mind-altering substances or a lot of money. Whether it’s cooking, capoeira, the guitar, or mountain biking, interests and hobbies add texture to your personality. Being “in the zone” is happiness. You lose the sense of time, forget yourself, and feel part of something larger.”</p>
<p>― Scott Galloway, The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning</p>

<p>If you don't have these, unfortunately accidentally you will lose some big part of you in this pandemic even if you survive the virus. </p>
