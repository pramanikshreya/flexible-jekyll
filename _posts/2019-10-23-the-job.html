<p>A lot of people I know are looking for a job that maybe pays them more. After a certain point it no longer is about a necessity to make basic ends meet but it is about the money only. Rarely, do people ask if that job is something they believe in.</p>
<p>Even if the overall purpose is money, people should work on something that they have a long term passion in. Because at the end of the day if you can't love what you are doing, you'll get bored and if you get bored your productivity will fall. You can use any number of tools in the market, if homo sapiens don't hope and know the purpose of doing what they are doing, it is going to be a huge barrier in earnings. Because you can't expect to be promoted or given bonuses if your productivity is not optimised.</p>
<p>I am not saying you will and must love every aspect of the job, but must love the path even if the path is sometimes filled with boring excels and documents.</p>
<p>If you cannot find something that makes you proud at all, then the life that you are living and the education and upbringing that brought you here is not something you deserved.</p>
<p>The only thing worse than living in a job is to stop looking for "the" job. So look out for what makes you passionate, and may be in this lifetime you will find something that's worth your life.</p>
