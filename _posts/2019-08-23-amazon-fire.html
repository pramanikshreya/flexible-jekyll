<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>Why bother, right?</span></p>
<p>Attempt to help recover the cost to recover the lungs. Nope, how can I as a PM of this country do such an audacious thing of taking the bloody help when I need one. My hypothetical ego will be crushed.</p>
<p>Let's anyways continue to do whatever the fuck we are doing. Because what can we do anyways. Capture Brazil in the interests of the humanity? Oh right, that happened with Syria, Iraq, etc etc. We homo sapiens might be the only species who kill our own, for fun. Other species haven't evolved that much yet from the stupidity side.</p>
<p>So let's dig a Amazon forest sized grave for our species. May our souls rest in peace.</p></div>
