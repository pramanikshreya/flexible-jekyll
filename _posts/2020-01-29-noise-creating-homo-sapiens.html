<div class="d9FyLd">The permissible <b>noise</b> level in <b>India</b></div>
<p><span class="e24Kjd">In industrial areas, the permissible limit is 75 dB for daytime and 70 dB at night. In commercial areas, it is 65 dB and 55 dB while in residential areas it is 55 dB and 45 dB during daytime and night respectively.</span></p>
<p>This allows people to blast loud music on festive days, so much so that I have to leave my home for taking a conference call. My head is going crazy. And guess what in Kolkata festive days are every week.</p>
<p>Most of the club with balls to blast loud music in the name of patriotism or religion are more often than not backed by local political parties.</p>
<p>Because if you are quiet, and there is no noise in your head, you will think and the grey brain cells will start activating which never works for the people in power.</p>
