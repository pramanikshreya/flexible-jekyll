<p>I have been reading Tuesdays with Morrie, with everything in this pandemic, seemed like a nice reminder to think that most of us have what most dying people yearn for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most dying people seems like they would do anything to spend some more time with their loved ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The book talks about Morrie a professor of sociology at Brandeis University. He loves to dance and make merry until he finds out that he is dying from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Morrie is shaken up by the news, yet, he manages to come to terms with his illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout “Tuesdays with Morrie”, we see the disease gradually taking over the joyful professor: he no longer dances; gets confined to a chair and is dependent on other people for moving around and other routine tasks."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet throughout this pandemic I have seen families doing everything apart from spending time with each other. They want to go out, meet their friends, party and spend time with some C2H5OH. Especially people who have the luxury to be able to spend time with their loved ones, and just follow all precautions, even they have faltered. Makes me kind of question whether truly most people are actually happy with their families (the one thing people spend their life building).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People want what they cannot have when they are alive. And when they are dying they realize what is truly important to them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another angle to this might just be an immense normalization of mass deaths of our species. One thing our evolution did not have time to catch on is how much easy would it be to get the news and knowledge of the world, and that processing of so much grief and weight from the sad news of the world leaves very little room to care for us and our immediate circle. So we just go on about our lives from one distraction to another. </p>
